# 🏡 Ames Housing Data Analysis

## 📚 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the Ames Housing dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The tasks completed include:

* Cleaning missing data (filling numerical columns with median and categorical columns with "None")
* Grouping data by categories and computing statistical summaries
* Visualizing insights using different types of plots

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Numerical columns were filled with their  **median values** .
* Categorical columns were filled with **"None"** to represent missing categories.

### 2. Grouping and Summary

* Grouped houses by **Neighborhood** and calculated the **average SalePrice** for each neighborhood.

### 3. Visualizations

Created four different visualizations:

* **Line Chart:** Showing the trend of average SalePrice by year the house was built.
* **Bar Chart:** Comparing average SalePrice across neighborhoods.
* **Histogram:** Showing the distribution of house SalePrices.
* **Scatter Plot:** Showing the relationship between above-ground living area (GrLivArea) and SalePrice, colored by Overall Quality.

## 🎯 Final Notes

* Missing values were handled carefully based on column type.
* Visualizations were customized with titles, axis labels, and legends for better readability.
